# 🏓 Modified Pong Game with Boosts and AI

A modernized version of the classic Pong game, built using **Python** and **Pygame**. This project enhances the original concept with new mechanics like ball boost, counter-attack, difficulty scaling, AI opponents, and dynamic visuals.

## 🎮 Game Overview

This game takes the classic Pong mechanics and introduces a layer of strategy and excitement. Players can boost the ball, trigger counter-attacks, and face off against either a weak or strong AI. The ball changes behavior based on game state, and visual elements adapt in real-time.

## 🧩 Key Features

### 💥 Ball Mechanics
- **Boost**: The ball speeds up temporarily when a player hits it at the right moment.
- **Counter-Attack**: After specific interactions, the ball reflects back with extra force.

### 🧠 AI Opponents
- **Weak AI**: Basic paddle movement and slower reactions.
- **Strong AI**: Faster, smarter, and more accurate paddle movement.

### 🎨 Visual and UI Enhancements
- **Dynamic messages** displayed (e.g., "Nice Shot!", "Too Slow!") based on gameplay.
- Scoreboard and health bar for each player.

---

### ⚙️ Game Modes and Difficulty

- Play against **Weak AI** or **Strong AI** 
- Difficulty increases dynamically based on the length of rally

---

### 🎮 Controls & Skills

- **Arrow Keys**: Move paddle up/down  
- **Spacebar**: Activate **Boost** (speed up the ball temporarily)  
- **Shift** (Left or Right): Trigger **Counter-Attack** (reflects ball with extra force)  
- Game will display visual cues and messages when these are activated

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python 3  
- **Library**: Pygame  
- **Architecture**: Object-Oriented Programming (Ball, Paddle, Game States)

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Install Pygame:
```bash
pip install pygame
```

2. Run the game:
```bash
python main.py
```

## 📚 What I Learned

- Creating **interactive game mechanics** with physics-based behavior  
- Implementing **Simple AI logic**
- Adding **game feel** elements like speed-ups, color feedback, and sound  
- Managing **game state transitions** and difficulty tuning
